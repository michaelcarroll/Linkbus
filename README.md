## Linkbus

Linkbus is an Android application that provides an always-accurate view of the "Link" bus schedule for the [College of Saint Benedict & Saint John's University](https://csbsju.edu/) campuses. 

App offerings for the school's bus schedule were weak and hadn't been updated for approximately 3 years, so I decided build my own. The app pulls data from [csbsju.edu/bus](https://csbsju.edu/bus) to provide the most accurate and up-to-date schedule, so any changes to the schedule are immediately reflected in the app.

## Installation

Linkbus is currently available for Android in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.carroll.michael.linkbus). In the future I plan to create a solution for iOS devices.

## Features

* **Lightweight:** App launches within 1-2 seconds and displays schedule immediately (much faster than loading a website)
* **Clean interface:** Expandable cards for each bus route (CardView), follows Material UI guidelines 
* **Date advancement:** Ability to view schedule for a future date, up to a week in advance
* **[JodaTime library](https://github.com/dlew/joda-time-android):** While Java has [built-in time handeling](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html), prior to Java 8 it has critical bugs and is difficult to use. JodaTime provides a solution for applications that need date/time management with many [benefits](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/#Why_Joda-Time). 
* **Remote messaging system:** Ability for developer to remotely set an Android SnackBar message to display on initial launch (for example, a special class schedule for the day â€” see screenshots)
